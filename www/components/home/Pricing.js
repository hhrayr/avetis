          We’re a team of scientists and engineers on a mission to dramatically
          increase our quality of life and create a thriving humanity. We believe
          that starts with a renewed focus on human intelligence (HI).

        <p className="text-left">
          Machines of all kinds can help us along the way, but our vision is one
          in which we humans maintain and expand our authorial power. The
          advanced intelligence of tomorrow is a collaboration between the natural
          and the artificial. United, unheard of possibilities abound.

          We’re building off two decades of breakthrough research, working closely
          with private partners and scientists to get usable solutions in the
          hands of people everywhere. We’re starting with potential applications
